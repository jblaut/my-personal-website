          Currently a Junior Developer in the Design and Engineering department at BBC.
          I joined BBC as a trainee during my placement year at University of Greenwich.
          Since joining the company 3 years ago, I have been lucky enough to work on 3 different teams, each with different set of skills required.
          I learnt how to adjust quickly to the changing environment.

          As mentioned above, I attended University of Greenwich and graduated in July 2017 with first class honours in BSc Web Technologies.
          My degree was mainly focused on Front End development, which is the area of web development that I feel most comfortable in.
          I have had experience working with a few programming languages, including:

        <ul>
          <li>PHP</li>
          <li>JavaScript (including Node.js, React, ES6)</li>
          <li>Ruby</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    )
  }
}
